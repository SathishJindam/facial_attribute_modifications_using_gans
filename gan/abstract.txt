								==============================================================================

	Facial Attribute Aims at editing images,.generate a new face with desired attributes while preserving other details.There are two types of methods for facial attribute editing ,the optimization based ones(CNAI,DFI), and the learning based ones(Neural Nets).To change the 
given face to the target face with expected attributes,CNAI defines an attribute loss as the CNN feature difference between the given face and a set of faces with the expected attributes and then minimizes this loss with respect to the given face.Based on the assumption that CNN linearizes the manifold of the natural images into Euclidean feature subspace.DFI is little complicated,it uses the vector algebra on feature vectors to own the desire attributes and similarity metric for reconstruction of other attributes which we do not intend to be changed.Optimization based methods need to conduct several or even many iterations for each testing image,which is not suitable for real world applications.   
Recently Generative adversarial net and encoder-decoder architecture are usually incorporated to handle this task with promising results.Based on the encoder-decoder architecture the latent representation(Encoded using autoencoders) is decoded to image which is expected to own the desired attributes.
=======
Problem:Model the relation between the latent representation and attributes (Latent-Representation <-->Attribute)   
======= 
1)Conditioning on the Latent Representation to generate the image which owns the desired attributes,but conditioning on Latent vector results information loss which can not be tolerated because we need to preserve the certain data(Attributes which we intend to keep).
2)Correlation between Images and attributes : Suppose we want to change the hair color of a Man(black to blonde) ,the network outputs an image which correlates with Blonde woman(Also changes Male face to Female),this arises because most of Blonde hair objects in dataset are Women.'Fader Networks' addresses this problem through Attribute invariant Latent Representation.
3)However ,Attributes portrays the characteristics of face image,simply imposing the attribute invariant constraint on Latent Representation results in poor representational ability.It is a trade off between invariance and information loss as mentioned in Fader Networks.
4)The paper we are interested in addresses the above problem through imposing Attribute classification Constraint,That means we Use our GAN Detective to distinguish between face attributes.Of Course it depends upon Quality of data that our Detective is being trained on.This Way Latent Representation is free of any Constraints and the generated image will be scrutinized by Detective to get feedback which improves the performance of the Decoder.
